# KT142C Voice Chip: A Selection Solution for 6 - segment Music IO Control and Button - battery Power Supply

When it comes to the selection of voice chips with the requirements of independent IO control for 6 segments of music and power supply by button batteries, there are specific key points. The core is that the chip should adopt the SOP16 package to meet the configuration of 6 IO ports and be able to work under low - power conditions at around 3V.

## Core Functional Requirements
1. **IO Resource Configuration**：To achieve independent control of 6 segments of music, with each segment corresponding to an independent IO trigger port, at least 6 independent IO pins are required for music trigger control.
2. **Package Form Requirement**：Only the SOP16 package structure can meet the required number of pins.
3. **Power Supply Characteristic Requirement**：The chip should be adaptable to 3V button - battery power supply and have the ability to operate with low power consumption.

## Particularities of the Power Supply System
1. **Standard Voltage**：Common button batteries such as CR2032 have a standard voltage of 3V.
2. **Capacity Limit**：Their capacity is usually less than or equal to 300mAh.
3. **Power - consumption Sensitivity**：Standby power consumption and playback power consumption must be optimized.

## Recommended Chip Solution: KT142C - SOP16
1. **Hardware Adaptability**
    - **Package Specification**：It adopts the SOP16 package form, with a total of 16 pins, 6 of which can be flexibly configured as independent IO trigger ports.
    - **Storage Configuration**：It has a built - in storage space of 320Kbyte, sufficient to support the storage of multiple audio segments.
    - **Voltage Range**：The operating voltage range is 2.6V - 5.5V, which is perfectly adapted to 3V button - battery power supply.
2. **Functional Characteristics**
    - **Trigger Control Mode**：It supports one - to - one trigger playback for 6 - way IO ports, with each IO port corresponding to an independent music segment.
    - **Power - consumption Control**
        - **Standby State**：Through a low - power mode design, the battery life cycle is effectively extended.
        - **Playback State**：The audio decoding power consumption is optimized to balance sound quality and power consumption.
