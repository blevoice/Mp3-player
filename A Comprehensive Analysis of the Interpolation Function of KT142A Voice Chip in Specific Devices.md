# A Comprehensive Analysis of the Interpolation Function of KT142A Voice Chip in Specific Devices

In devices such as game consoles and elevators, the interpolation function of voice chips has practical requirements. That is, during the playback of background music, a prompt tone can be triggered to play, and after the playback is completed, the background music resumes. Regarding the use of the KT142A voice chip, the following points need attention:

## 1. File Management
### 1.1 Prompt Tone Folders
- Prompt tone files should be placed in the "ADVERT1 - ADVERT9" folders, with a maximum of 9.
- Naming must follow this rule; otherwise, there will be functional abnormalities.
- The number of files in each folder should not exceed 255.
- File name format is "three - digit number + suffix", such as "001.mp3".

### 1.2 Background Music Storage
- Background music can be stored in folders such as "01, 02" or in the root directory.

## 2. Storage Devices
- TF cards, USB flash drives, and external SPI FLASH are supported.
- Background music and prompt tones need to be stored on the same device and distinguished by different folders.

## 3. Instruction Operations
### 3.1 Interpolation Instructions
- The interpolation instructions of KT142A follow specific rules.
    - For example, to interpolate the track "001" in the "ADVERT1" folder, the instruction is 7E 25 02 01 01 EF.

### 3.2 Playback Instructions
- For background music stored in folders such as "01/02", use the 0x0F instruction to specify playback or loop.
- For background music stored in the root directory, use the 0x03 instruction to play or loop in physical order.
- In the stopped state, the tracks in the ADVERTn folder can be played directly through the 0x25 instruction, and the playback process can be interrupted midway.

## 4. Playback Characteristics
### 4.1 Interpolation Characteristics
- Playing the prompt tone does not interrupt the original playback state.
- After the playback is completed, it returns to the original position to continue playing.

## Key Notice
- The prompt tone folders must be named as specified.
- The original folders such as "01/02" need to be renamed.
- Background music and prompt tones need to be managed in different folders of the same device, and cross - device calls are not allowed.
